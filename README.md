# Matters need attention

Newtonâ€™s iteration method was employed to estimate the inverse functions of non-invertible Gaussian upper and lower bound functions or the original Gaussian Q function.

All the research results are presented in a pdf file called Newton Iteration. The text and data presented in the report may contain a lot of errors because it is not an official result, but it basically shows the overall research idea. There are also files called "Tangent_Lines_NT_GIF" and "Tangent_Lines_on_Bounds_Zoom.fig" that visualize the method so that the reader can understand the project more intuitively.

The project was completed from March to June 2022 by Maximal-K.
